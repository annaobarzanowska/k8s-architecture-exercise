# Kubernetes Architecture Exercise

This is an exercise to design a Kubernetes-based architecture which is capable of running highly-available microservices at scale. The requirements are deliberately loose to allow for maximum freedom with design, you decide what the application is for based on what you'd like to show. We'd like to see how you approach this scenario using any cloud native tools or applications which you feel are suitable. Please carefully consider any choices you make in your design, and be prepared to justify them.

**You should aim to spend no more than 90 minutes on this task, if you run out of time, write down what you what have done next.**

## Requirements

Create an architecture diagram using your tool of choice (we recommend Excalidraw or Draw.io) for a Kubernetes cluster which runs an application based on the [podinfo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) project.

The solution should be secure, highly-available, and implement horizontal scaling using a metric available in the podinfo service.

Consider all aspects of the infrastructure, including ingress & egress traffic, configuration of Kubernetes, and how you would deploy this infrastructure, and the workloads within it.

## Considerations

Please be mindful of the following considerations as you work through this solution:

- Security
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Monitoring & Observability
- Cost effectiveness

Our questions will be around these topics mainly.
